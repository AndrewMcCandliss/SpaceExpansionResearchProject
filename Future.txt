Uninteresting rules:

For tokens
Probability to go right, left, or center


For boxes
num of boxes = constant


Starting States:
All tokens in one box



Entropy:
Information Entropy
	states i = 1,,,, N
	h = - sum over i of Pbox * lnPbox
	Each box, for Pbox = #tokens in box / total # of tokens
	h = 0 when all tokens are in one box
	Need to calculate h and hmax
